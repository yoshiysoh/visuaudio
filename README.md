# visuaudio
VISUalizing AUDIO by mathematical/physical way.
Creating generative art from audio.

# General idea
- From spectral information of the audio, create something cool.
- This project approach creative area between generative art and math/physics.
- Also this code become very visual for party.
## Idea
- spectral as input for the system
- spectral as potential landscape for the system
- spectral as a noise

# TODO
## Phase 0 (general direction of this project)
- [x] deciding the name of this project
- [x] fixing the general concept of this project
- [ ] make logo of this project
## Phase 1 (spectral analysis of input audio)
- [ ] PyAudio
- [ ] STFT
- [ ] Gabor
- [ ] Wigner-Ville
