# visuaudio
Visualizing audio by various way.
Creating generative art from audio.

# General idea
From spectral information of the audio, create something cool.
This project approach creative area between generative art and physics.

# TODO
- [ ] make logo of this project
- [ ] STFT
- [ ] Gabor
- [ ] Wigner-Ville
- [ ] Changing Hamiltonian of SchrÃ¶dinger equation
- [ ] stable fluid
- [ ] cellluar automata, also hexbin, also Lenia
- [ ] draw line from spectral information i.e. strange attractor?
- [ ] draw line by vector representation of spectral
- [ ] perturbation to gravitational field
- [ ] flacking Vicsek model
- [ ] make 2D potential from spectral -> gravitational, Schr«Ódinger/Wigner, electric/magnetic field, temperature gradient,
